# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the provided code attempts to access a user based on an ID passed as a route parameter.  However, it fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid number, resulting in potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code.  It attempts to parse the user ID as an integer without any validation or error handling.  If the ID is not a number, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, causing the `find` method to fail silently or throw an error, depending on the implementation of the `users` array.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version of the code.  It includes comprehensive error handling to check if the ID is a valid number and to return appropriate error responses if it's not.
